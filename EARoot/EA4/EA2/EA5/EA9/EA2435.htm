	<div class="ObjectTitle">Figure PF.02 - Service, Resource, and Performance diagram</div>
	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">The following Figure shows the associations that performance entities have with existing service and resource entities, as well as the association that the Performance entity has with the Customer entity.&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that the dark-shaded entities, CustomerFacingServiceSpecification and CustomerFacingService are not within the scope of the model as they related the Service domain with the Product domain, which is out of scope at this point in time.&#160;&#160;Also note that the ResouceSpecification is related directly to the PerformanceSpecification entity and Resource is related to the Performance entity, since both Service and Resource performance deal with Resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Service Performance ABE collects, correlates, consolidates, and validates various performance statistics and other operational characteristics of customer and resource facing service entities. It provides a set of entities that can monitor and report on performance. Each of these entities also conducts network performance assessment against planned goals, performs various aspects of trend analysis, including error rate and cause analysis and Service degradation.&#160;&#160;Entities in this ABE also manage the traffic generated by a Service, as well as traffic trend analysis. This is important for newer technologies that separate data, control and management functions for a given Service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Resource Performance ABE collects, correlates, consolidates, and validates various performance statistics and other operational characteristics of Resource entities. It provides a set of entities that can monitor and report on performance. The entities in this ABE provide physical, logical, and performance information. Each of these entities also conducts network performance assessment against planned goals, performs various aspects of trend analysis, including error rate and cause analysis and Resource degradation. Entities in this ABE also manage traffic in a Resource. This includes statistics defining Resource loading, and traffic trend analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The associations with the specification entities provide part of the definition of the performance specification entities.&#160;&#160;For example, the specification of a GGSN and SGSN define the types of network elements whose performance is measured.&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;The cardinality of the association between ResourceSpecification and PerformanceSpecification is 0,2 because at most two types of resources&#8217; performance is defined by a PerformanceSpecification.&#160;&#160;Similarly, the association between Resource and Performance also has a cardinality of 0,2.&#160;&#160;These Resource domain entities are directly related to the respective Performance ABE entities and not to ResourcePerformanceSpec and ResourcePerformance.&#160;&#160;The reason is that Resources are used to measure both Service-related and Resource-related performance.&lt;br/&gt;For the ServiceSpecification entity the cardinality is 1 because a given instance of a ServicePerformanceSpec entity measures the performance of a single ServiceSpecification entity, such as a mobile voice call.&#160;&#160;Similarly, the cardinality of the association between a Service and a Service performance is 1.&lt;br/&gt;The cardinality between a Customer and Performance is 0,1 because an instance of Performance may or may not be a measure of performance for an instance of Customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Refer to Common Domain guide book section Performance ABE for more details&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
