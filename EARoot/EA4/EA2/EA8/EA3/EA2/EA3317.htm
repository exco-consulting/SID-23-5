Therefore, they were added as ABEs.&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview of Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When incorporating key Security Management concepts into the SID model, the modelers focused on the five primary concepts: assets, threats, vulnerabilities, &lt;br/&gt;The following entities are core to the security model: &lt;br/&gt;SecurityEntity: Used to describe any asset that exposes security related vulnerabilities, and has the potential for security related events.&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;SecurityVulnerability: Potential weakness that may be exploited by an adversary or threat.&lt;br/&gt;SecurityThreatExploit and SecurityThreatTechnique: Threats represent entities and characteristics of entities that may maliciously or non-maliciously exploit vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;SecurityThreatActor: Use &#8220;techniques&#8221; such as social engineering, or phishing to maneuver assets into positions where they can use &#8220;exploits&#8221; to take advantage of weaknesses to gain access or information that is either inherently valuable, or can be used to gain further access.&lt;br/&gt;SecurityEvents and SecurityIncidents: Incidents and events are recorded and reported. The primary difference is that incidents result from assessment(s) of event(s).&lt;br/&gt;SecurityIncidentImpact: Supports information such as, how the incident was allowed to happen, what threat actor caused it, and how &#8220;bad&#8221; the damage is.&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;The model shows that a Security Entity, such as a network element, exhibits Vulnerabilities, which may be taken advantage of by a Security Threat Technique, specifically targeted by a Security Threat Exploit.&#160;&#160;A Security Event exposes the	e Vulnerability and may result in a Security Incident being created to resolve and fix the Vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;</div>
