	<div class="ObjectTitle">Figure Pr.03 - Product Specification - Basic Entities diagram</div>
	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">Products are things (tangible or intangible) which enterprises, such as service providers, market, sell or lease to customers to create profit.&#160;&#160;In a changing world, monopoly telcos with a custom-built portfolio have been replaced by a value network of Suppliers and Service Providers offering complex communications-based Products. The way in which those Products have to be specified is not as simple as it used to be.&#160;&#160;&lt;br/&gt;A product serves as a window for customers and users into the world of the services and resources used to realize the product. &lt;br/&gt;Customer/user always deals with products, unless the individual/organization they represent is playing the role of a service technician or some similar role. A user uses a Product to obtain its value promise, e.g. to make a phone call&lt;br/&gt;Neither the Product User nor the Customer can see the CustomerFacingService. They only can see the Product.&lt;br/&gt;A ProductSpecification may be simple (atomic) or a composition of other ProductSpecifications [Fowler-Specification]. A ProductSpecification may represent a tangible object or something intangible provided to customers, realized as a &#8216;service&#8217; but not to be confused with a network service here. The SID modeling of a CompositeProductSpecification covers both the physical build of more than one ProductSpecification and one or more ProductSpecifications supplied together in a collection. ProductSpecifications may also exist within groupings, such as product categories or product lines or product types.&lt;br/&gt;Enterprises may assemble products themselves or they may buy them in from other suppliers (through contractual agreements where the enterprise takes the role of customer - see SID Common Domain guide book); or they may do a combination of these things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Specification Example - The &quot;3G Mobile super saver pack&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is sold via intermediaries (&quot;Dog-n-Bones-R-Us&quot; phone shops) as a &quot;BigTelephone&quot; branded product.&#160;&#160;Nokia supply the phones and provides a 2-year guarantee. The &quot;BigTelephone&quot; network is used for voice and they supply a phone number and a SIM card.&#160;&#160;The SMS function is provided by &quot;Best Messaging&#8221;, as &quot;BigTelephone&quot; doesn&#39;t have an SMS function.&#160;&#160;The customer signs the contract with &quot;Dog-n-Bones-R-Us&quot; for 2 years with minimum monthly calls and Dog-n-Bones-R-Us bills the customer directly.&#160;&#160;Dog-n-Bones-R-Us has a separate contract with &#8220;Best Messaging&#8221; to cover the use of their SMS function. In looking at the detail of ProductSpecification, the following concepts are modeled by the figure below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Relationships between different ProductSpecifications for bundling or composite specifications;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Different attributes for different types of ProductSpecification; for example, some Products the customer can take home with them, others they experience as a Service; for example, one delivered across a network;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8226;	Atomic ProductSpecifications which cannot be broken down further. &lt;br/&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8226;	CompositeProductSpecifications which comprise a number of other ProductSpecifications, any of which may provide more than one instance per CompositeProductSpecification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:&#160;&#160;A ProductSpecification cannot contain itself, but it can reference other ProductSpecifications.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one action is allowed for a ProductSpecification (AllowedProductAction) such as create, update&#8230;that might be limited to one or many SalesChannels. An AllowedProductAction has a type represented by a ProductTypeAction.&lt;br/&gt;For ProductOffering a Customer could upgrade their offering on the web, but to downgrade they need to come into a store or contact a service representative.&lt;br/&gt;An AllowedProductAction might imply changes from one ProductConfigSpec to one or many ProductConfigSpec.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, it is possible to define actions such as upgrade or downgrade and specify which SalesChannel enables these actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all combinations of products, there must be clearly defined relationships between the products in order to ensure consistency of service to the customer.&#160;&#160;Some examples of such ProductSpecificationRelationships would be migration, exclusivity, dependency and substitution, as indicated in the Figure below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often it becomes essential to group product specifications. SID supports following two ways in which product specifications can be grouped&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Based on how the product specs are organized in a product portfolio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Based on common characteristics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />These groupings are supported by ProductSpecificationType entity and its two subclasses Product Line (Based on how the product specs are organized in a product portfolio) and Product Category (Based on common characteristics). Product Line represents the coarsest form of grouping of product specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#8220;ProductSpecificationType&#8221; is a specialization of &#8220;EntitySpecificationType&#8221; and as such it inherits the recursive association &#8220;EntitySpecificationTypeRelationship&#8221;. This can be used to represent how a Product Line is associated to multiple Product Categories. For example, ProductLine &#8220;Home Security&#8221; is composed of different Product Categories &#8220;Door Alarms&#8221;, &#8220;Security Lights&#8221;, &#8220;GPS &amp; Tracking&#8221; etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Same Product Category can also be used across different Product Lines. For example, same set of &#8220;Mobile phones&#8221; Product Category reused across Product Lines &#8220;Mobile Residential&#8221; and &#8220;Mobile Enterprise&#8221;.&lt;br/&gt;The decision regarding when to model a ProductLine or ProductCategory is often left to the discretion of the Product/Marketing managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also costs associated with creating, developing and maintaining a ProductSpecification; the enterprise records these against the ProductSpecification.&#160;&#160;There is an implied link between the ProductSpecificationCost entity and business information, but this has not been explored in this area of the SID model.&lt;br/&gt;</div>
