	<div class="ObjectTitle">Figure Pr.44 - Product Specification - Characteristics and Versions diagram</div>
	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">ProductSpecifications also have a variety of characteristics, such as a printer&#8217;s dimensions, paper capacity, print speed, color, and so forth, and possible values associated with the characteristics.&#160;&#160;The SID uses ProductSpecification Characteristic and ProductSpecCharacteristicValue to represent the properties for a ProductSpecification [Fowler-Properties] as shown in Figure Pr.4 on the following page.&#160;&#160;Additional information regarding this pattern can be found in Common Domain guide book section Root Business Entities ABE.&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics can be grouped into four different types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;If a characteristic has a discrete value (e.g. color or business coding), it may be derived from a range of allowable values;&#160;&#160;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a characteristic describes the product within a parameter range&#160;&#160;(e.g. dimension), it may be defined with a &#8216;high value&#8217; and a &#8216;low value&#8217; [Fowler-Range] ;&#160;&#160;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a characteristic value is &#8216;derived&#8217;, it will use other parameters in a formula.&#160;&#160;N.B.&#160;&#160;There are business rules implied here that require more work in a future phase of the SID Product definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a characteristic has no predefined values and unconstrained values (no business rules and no ranges/allowed values)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />Characteristics can also be bundled together into packages by using the ProductSpecCharRelationship.&#160;&#160;For example, a number of electrical characteristics can be grouped together using an &#8220;electrical properties&#8221; characteristic that represents a composite of the detailed properties, such as power requirements, plug requirements, and so forth.&#160;&#160;This entity can also be used for a number of other relationships between characteristics, such as mutually exclusive, inclusive, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;CharacteristicValues can reference other CharacteristicValues.&lt;br/&gt;As ProductSpecifications are upgraded, and as the market and technology move on, they are subject to version control.&#160;&#160;If there is a significant change of capabilities, a new ProductSpecification is created.&lt;br/&gt;When a product is created based on a ProductSpecification (see Product Offering below), the party may also have the option to choose from a set of properties values, such as color, or may be able to choose one from a number of product properties.&#160;&#160;Where a ProductSpecificationCharacteristic is interchangeable with others in this way, it is modeled as a ConfigurableProductSpecificationCharacteristic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Characteristic Example &#8211; Email ProductSpecification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;ProductSpecCharacteristics and their related ProductSpecCharacteristicValues can be used to support capabilities provided by ProductSpecifications.&#160;&#160;For example, an Email may have a number of features, such as Spam protection, storage, message size, virus scanning and cleaning, mail forwarding, archiving, and so forth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;One way this type of product can be introduced into a model is by sub-classing the Product entity and including each feature as an attribute of an EmailProduct subclass.&#160;&#160;But this means that each time a new type of product is introduced the information architecture and most likely the application that supports the Product ABE would have to be changed.&#160;&#160;This is sometimes viewed as a static extension to information architecture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A more dynamic approach is to consider these features as instances of a ProductSpecCharacteristic.&#160;&#160;In this example each feature has a value associated with it.&#160;&#160;The value associate with Spam protection is &#8220;SpamBlock&#8221;; the value associated with storage is &#8220;1GB&#8221;; the value associated with message size is &#8220;10BM&#8221;; the value associated with virus scanning and cleaning is &#8220;included&#8221;; the value associated with mail forwarding is &#8220;included&#8221;; the value associated with archiving is &#8220;included. Note that note all characteristics have to have values at specification time. For example, user ID are capabilities, but the value is assigned when an instance of a Product is created.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The example will be continued in the Product section of this addendum&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</div>
