	<div class="ObjectTitle">Figure SO.35 - Interaction Between PartyRole and Service diagram</div>
	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">A PartyRole defines the function that a Party takes on. PartyRoles can represent the ability to manage, configure, use, and perform other types of interactions with Services. A simple starting model is shown in the Figure below.&lt;br/&gt;One can see that the Service and Resource management methods are symmetrical. Therefore, this section will only discuss the Service ownership and administration classes.&lt;br/&gt;The OwnsServiceDetails association class defines a Service (CustomerFacing or ResourceFacing) that a particular PartyRole owns. Note that this is a very different relationship than the AdministersServiceDetails association class. The OwnsServiceDetails association class defines the PartyRole that is the owner of the Service. Here, &#8220;owner&#8221; is the person or group that is responsible (e.g., organizational, financial, and so forth) for the Service. Note that the cardinality of the OwnsServiceDetails association class on the PartyRole side is 1 &#8211; this means that a Service MUST have at least one PartyRole to manage it. Furthermore, the cardinality of this association on the Service side is *, which ensures that a PartyRole doesn&#8217;t have to own a Service.&lt;br/&gt;The AdministersServiceDetails association class defines a Service (CustomerFacing or ResourceFacing) that a particular Party, playing a PartyRole, administers. From a business perspective, the Owner has to either appoint or give permission to the Administrator to administer the Service that is owned. This is done using the GrantsServiceAdminRights association class.&lt;br/&gt;The GrantsServiceAdminRights association defines which PartyRoles are allowed to administer a particular owned Service. Different PartyRoles will in general have different administration rights for the same Service. For example, different types of Administrators will in general each have the ability to make more changes than different types of Technicians.&lt;br/&gt;Policies can be defined for controlling the specific rights of administering a Service. This is the function of the ServiceManagementPolicy class. Only a simple single attribute is shown.&lt;br/&gt;The ServiceManagementPolicy class defines the particular policies that are used to define how different aspects of the Service are managed and maintained. For example, assume that a Service is made up of several sub-Services. One of these sub-Services might require multiple PartyRoles to approve changes to its configuration, whereas another sub-Service might not require any approvals to change its configuration. Since Policy also uses the composite pattern, if a set of Policies are needed, these can be aggregated into a single Policy).&lt;br/&gt;Note the power of this pattern &#8211; the ManagementPolicyForService association, along with its ServiceManagementPolicy class, provide a generic template for defining which set of PartyRoles can perform which type of management function for which type of Service. Figure SO.35 shows that Services and Resources can be managed using the same pattern, even though the contents of the classes will be different.&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot more to the model that may be developed further.&lt;br/&gt;</div>
