	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A Measure expresses the specification of a calculation that can be evaluated against a set of measurands to create an instance of a Measurement.&#160;&#160;&#160;A Measure has a Scope, which specified a single class of element expressed in the Meta model for the system being analyzed. SMM defines a &quot;measurand&quot; relationship between the Measurement and a MofElement, which points at a particular instance of a class in the target Meta model.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;An SMMModel is comprised by a set of observations. The Observation class represents some of the contextual information which may be unique to a measurement, such as date, measurer, and tool used. The ObservationScope class represents the model(s) or sub models that are the subject of the related observation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The binding of a Measure to a particular Measurement is expressed by the ObservedMeasure relationship class, which ties a Measure to a set of Measurements resulting from an Observation, on a set of related measurands, evaluated at an instance of time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A Measure has a Scope, which specified a single class of element expressed in the Meta model for the system being analyzed.&#160;&#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A Measure is associated with a single named Characteristic. The Characteristic class represents a property or trait of the members in its scope, a set of MOF Elements, which may be characterized by applying a measure to those members. Characteristic provides for a representation of a hierarchy of measures based upon the abstraction of measured trait. For example, a length characteristic may be the parent of the fileLength and programLength characteristics.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A MeasureCategory has measures and other categories as its elements. A category represents the measures directly associated with an &#8216;element&#8217; and the measures of each sub-category likewise associated with an &#8216;element.&#8217;&#160;&#160;A measure may appear in multiple categories. A category can be a subcategory of other categories indicating only that its measures also are measures of these other categories. This class may be used to represent a family of similar measures that apply to different scopes. The category of a metric may indicate the kind of purpose for which the metric is used.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;When a SMM model is run against a set of software artifacts, the measurands are the targets for evaluating the SMM Model to determine the values of a set of Measurements expressed as instances of the SMM metamodel.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;A Measure expresses the specification of a calculation that can be evaluated against a set of measurands to create an instance of a Measurement.&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;MeasureRelationship is an abstract class representing any relationship between two measures.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The MeasureLibrary class represents libraries of measures.&#160;&#160;A library of measures defines a reference set of measures that can be applied over and over in a way that is independent and decoupled from the models under observation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The structure of the Measure relationships is expressed in the SMM metamodel, as shown in Figure A-2. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
