	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">&lt;font color=&quot;#e0121d&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples to Illustrate the New ABEs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;Shown here are examples that illustrate the various ways a PartyRole is involved with ProductSpecifications and ProductOfferings. These will be used to explain the need for new ABEs.&#160;&#160;They will be used later in this document to show instances of the entities in the new ABEs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;Note 1: The examples presented below are based on two different kinds of marketplace illustrating various types of roles between the various business partners. The reader should interpret these examples in the context of a Telecom Service Provider who has created its own marketplace with different business partners exposing various digital product offering such as telecom devices, alarm, IoT systems, music or movies distribution services, etc...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;Note 2: All the illustrations express the views of the Service Provider.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;There are various ways in which an offering can be made to the market.&#160;&#160;Amazon was chosen as an example because of the variety of ways it does so. These and other ways offerings are made available in today&#8217;s digital world should be supported by the Information Framework.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The Amazon example shows the various ways Amazon offers a Thermo-Kitty Heated cat bed, one of which is offered by Amazon, and offered on behalf of other vendors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;Three offers are proposed by Amazon.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The first offer is Amazon&#8217;s offer for which Amazon is in charge of all the processes (order handling, purchasing, fulfillment,..). The price for this offer is $38.95.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The second offer is Quidsi&#8217;s offer for which Quidsi is the provider and has delegated several processes to Amazon (order handling, fulfillment, collecting payment..). The price for this offer is $44.79.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The third offer is GlobalPets&#8217; offer for which GlobalPets is the provider and has delegated only the order handling to Amazon. The price for this offer is $48.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Etsy Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;There is another marketplace that makes offers, such as jewelry, furniture, and mobile accessories, available to the market. Etsy is a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. The heart and soul of Etsy is our global community: the creative entrepreneurs who use Etsy to sell what they make or curate, the shoppers looking for things they can&#8217;t find anywhere else, the manufacturers who partner with Etsy sellers to help them grow, and the Etsy employees who maintain and nurture our marketplace.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;One thing different about this marketplace is that purchases from multiple vendors on a single order are sometimes paid for directly to each vendor when the order is placed with Etsy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#e0121d&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#e0121d&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Party Role Product Specification and Offering ABEs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;Described here are two new level 2 ABEs that have been added to support the variety of roles played by parties associated with ProductSpecifications and ProductOfferings.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The Party Role Product Specification ABE has been added as a level 2 ABE within the level 1 Product Specification ABE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;There may be a question as to why this ABE was added in addition to Party Role Product Offering ABE. The answer is:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#29313b&quot;&gt;The different PartyRoles&#8217; involvement with a ProductSpecification may require different levels of service as defined by ServiceLevelSpecifications. ServiceLevelSpecifications are used by ServiceLevelAgreements and are comprised of parameters that are measured, thresholds, and consequences if a threshold is crossed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following Figure shows the PartyRoleProductSpecification entity and its related entities.&lt;br/&gt;The PartyRoleProdSpecRelationship entity defines relationships between/among PartyRoleProductSpecification entities.&lt;br/&gt;For example, for a ProductSpecification sold / rented by the Service Provider and bought to a Supplier, it could be useful to have two instances of ProductSpecification in order to be able to either extend its description or restrict the possible configurations of the purchased ProductSpecification. In this case, the PartyRoleProdSpecRelationship would be used to qualify the relation between these two instances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
