	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">Revenue sharing is the distribution of revenue, the amount paid by customers or other parties to an enterprise, between stakeholders, who could be partners, a company&#39;s employees, or between companies in a business alliance. The purpose of revenue sharing is using shared revenue to benefit parties involved. Before the revenue is shared by enterprise and one or more other parties, they enter into a party revenue sharing agreement, which specifies how revenue will be shared among the parties involved.&lt;br/&gt;The Party Revenue Sharing ABE contains party revenue sharing models, party revenue sharing agreements, party revenue shares, and party revenue sharing reconciliations. The Party Revenue Sharing Model contains revenue sharing models that define how revenue is shared by an enterprise with one or more other parties. Revenue sharing models are a key component of revenue sharing agreements. The Party Revenue Sharing Agreement ABE contains an agreement that specifies how revenue will be shared between an enterprise and one or more other parties whose product offerings are made available in some way by an enterprise. The Party Revenue Share ABE uses existing artifacts such as usage, invoices, product prices, and applied billing rates that specifies how revenues will be shared. The Party Revenue Share Reconciliation ABE represents the alignment and agreement for two sets of party revenue sharing records. Each ABE is further described in upcoming sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Party Revenue Sharing Model ABE contains party revenue sharing models, and their specifications, that define how revenue is shared by and enterprise with one or more other parties. Revenue sharing models are a key component of revenue sharing agreements. The following Figure shows the model for the specification part of the ABE.&lt;br/&gt;RevShareModelSpecNegotiableRange specifies ranges expressed in percentages or some other quantitative measure that an enterprise will use to negotiate the aspects of a party revenue sharing model. More complex ranges, such as for tiered and progressive revenue sharing models may be based on policy defined by an enterprise. For example, a tiered model may have a range of 60-70% revenue share for up to 100 product offerings acquired and a range of 80-90% for above 100 offerings. Ranges may also include a range of prices for an offering paired with revenue sharing ranges. To date there are no common processes that can be used to define policies defined by an enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;The association to EntitySpecCharUse provides the ability to associate additional attributes for PartyRevenueSharingModelSpecifications. &lt;br/&gt;</div>
